# Week-1 RevoU Assignment üë®‚Äçüíª

## Simple Personal Website using basic HTML, CSS and Java Script


This is my first repository and it's also my first project. I created a simple personal website that includes a profile, contact/social media, and a youtube channel page. Here, I purely used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is recommended to be viewed on a desktop as I haven't figured out how to make it responsive.
