                Hello, I'm <strong>Yuza</strong>ðŸ‘‹ <br>
                So today is June 10, 2023. This is my first project for week 1, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
                I am a career switcher from an Electronic Engineer to Software Engineer. I want to learn about being a Full-Stack Software Engineer because it has significant opportunities in the current digital world.<br>
                There might be a tech winter in the future, but I believe as long as I have good skills and attitude, it won't be a problem. I am confident in succeeding in the technology field, and the coding world will not die.<br>
                Perhaps in the future, I will explore Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I can't wait to contribute to the software engineering world.
                <br><br>
